## 🚀 Project Overview
Textual Emotion Recognition (TER) is a **machine learning and NLP project** that detects emotions from text data.  

It classifies textual content into **seven core emotions**:  
**joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt.**  

The system is powered by:
- **n-gram feature extraction** for contextual understanding  
- **Machine learning classifiers** (SVC, Linear SVC, Random Forest, Decision Trees)  
- **Emoji-based visualization** for intuitive feedback  

This project is perfect for:
- Experimenting with NLP techniques  
- Sentiment analysis applications  
- Mental health monitoring and chatbot systems  
- Portfolio projects to impress recruiters

## 🌟 Features
- 🌐 Detect emotions in textual data automatically  
- 🏗 Modular architecture for extensibility  
- 📊 Multiple ML classifiers for comparison and accuracy  
- 🎨 Emoji-based visualization for better user experience  
- 💾 Save results in CSV or database for further analysis

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Numpy**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
